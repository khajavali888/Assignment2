        <p>C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs and first released in 1983 as "C with Classes," later renamed C++. It is an extension of the C programming language, incorporating object-oriented features and other enhancements. C++ is known for its speed, efficiency, and control over system resources, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
            C++ is a compiled language, meaning that source code must be translated into machine code before it can be executed. It is often described as a "middle-level" language, bridging the gap between high-level languages (like Python or Java) and low-level languages (like assembly). This allows programmers to have fine-grained control over hardware while still benefiting from higher-level abstractions. </p>
