        <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used to build applications across platformsâ€”from web and mobile apps to enterprise software. It is known for its Write Once, Run Anywhere capability, meaning code written in Java can run on any device that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
            Java shares similarities with other C-based languages like C++ and C#, especially in terms of syntax and structure. Its robustness, cross-platform compatibility, and strong memory management have made it a go-to language for developers worldwide for over two decades.</p>
